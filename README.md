# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘

## My Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What I will create

I'm going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, I should be able to monitor my bitcoin investents on the move!

## Stuff I will add one day in the future:

- Alerts and notification of set prices
- Graphs 
- Possibility to buy/sell on binance automatically
